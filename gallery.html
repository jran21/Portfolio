            The author Oscar Wilde argues that disobedience is a valuable human trait and that it promotes social progress. Throughout history, men have rebelled against any injustice they see, be it social or otherwise. The concept of freedom fuels those that disobey and try to bring social progress to society. This disobedience can come in any form depending on the ideals and morals of the person behind the act of disobedience. Disobedience can be considered any action of going against a higher authority’s decisions. I partially agree with Wilde’s claim because, while there are times in history where his claim has been proven true, there are also cases where disobedience does not promote social progress.
